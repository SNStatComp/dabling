# dabling
AI-assisted classification

Dabling is a research project of Statistics Netherlands.

This repo contains a shiny dashboard developed within the joint international project [ESSnet AIML4OS Work Package 10](https://github.com/AIML4OS/WP10) that shows what can be done with the Dabling concept for classification.

This first version of the dashboard contains synthetic texts and a demo classification to show the concept. Additional classifications and examples will be added later.
