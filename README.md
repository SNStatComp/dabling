AI-assisted classification

Dabling is a research project of Statistics Netherlands.

The demo shiny dashboard in this repository is one of the outputs of [ESSnet AIML4OS Work Package 10](https://github.com/AIML4OS/WP10).
The dashboard serves as an example of what can be doen with the Dabling concept, developed in the resaerch program at Statistics Netherlands. In this dashboard the  concept is applied to statistical classification.

The dashboard contains synthetic texts and classification for now and will be extended later with more functionality.
